# Checkers | Final Projects

Week Seven.


## Checkers
You know what is super exciting?  Group projects.  :)


This week was pretty interesting.  We were split into four groups, each group was multidisciplinary -- Rails, Frontend, iOS.  Together we were tasked with building a multiplayer and multidevice checkers game.  While we didn't accomplish all of the goals we set out to do, we got most of them and learned a lot in the process.


I didn't get to do much work with the iOS group, they were kind of off in their own little world.  However I did work pretty closely with the Rails portion of our team.
My favorite part was the first time we got player movement working across multiple screens at the same time.  ie Player 1 moves and it shows the move on Player 2's screen.  There was much high-fiving and cheering when that happened.



Pros:

  - Instant feedback
  - Watching other people debug
  - Watching web requests on the server and the browser console
  - Interacting with users of another language
  - Seeing two systems work together


Cons:

  - Doing work, but having to wait to see if it was correct
  - Our team didn't pick a leader, it was lead by consensus
  - We started planning the first day, but went with a more informal execution process
  - I should have written test


My biggest take away was learning how to estimate tasks.  I learned that it is something I need to work on. I assume the more I do this the better I will get at it.


## Final Project
I talked to the Rails instructor and he shot down my emulator idea.  While kind of bummed he made very good arguments about why I shouldn't do it for my capstone project.

However he did help me keep my final project in the realm of NES.  I will be working on a NES sprite editor.  I have done some of the preliminary work this week (week 8, I write these a week after) and I am able to pull the sprite (CHR) data from a NES ROM.  I've put the work up on my [Github](https://github.com/xeinherjar/nixel) page.  The code is a mess, but that's okay.  Just a quick exercise to make sure this is feasible, and it is.

One thing I really want to do is write up how the NES processes and draws pixels.  I found a lot of good information online but most of it assumes some previous knowledge.

And a few screen shots to show it off.
