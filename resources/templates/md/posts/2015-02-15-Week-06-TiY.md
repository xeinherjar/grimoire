# Testing | MV\* | Emulators

Week Six.

In school this week we covered unit and integration testing, MV\* frameworks and deployment.
I don't have much to say about these other than: *Backbone*...  You make my life much easier.

## Chip-8 Emulator
We have a very busy week coming up so we had a light weekend, instead of relaxing I decided to build a Chip-8 emulator.  If you are unfamiliar with the [Chip-8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) it is a virtual platform from the 70s.  It allowed programmers to write their games once and then they would run wherever the Chip-8 VM would run.  It used a hexbased keypad, so its a little janky compared to modern controllers.

Getting the screen to draw was one of the most exciting things I've ever done.

It's up on Github so you should check it out or better yet, [take it for a spin](http://xeinherjar.github.io/chip8/).

The source code is fairly well commented, but please reach out if you have any questions.

This was a very fun project to do and is really making me lean towards working on a NES emulator.  While the Chip8 is much much much easier to build than an NES I think that if I start planning now, I might be able to pull it off.  I still need to get the okay on this for my final project.  I was informed that the Rails instructor has built a NES emulator in Lisp, so I will have to talk to him about it.
