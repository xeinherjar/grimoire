#Why Vim?

It's ubiquitous.
I don't have to leave my terminal.
I can customize it.

But also because it is a new tool.  As a developer, it seems I will spend my time mostly doing the following: thinking and typing.  I can't control what I think with, but I have some control over my tools.

## Navigation
Navigation has honestly been the most difficult part to get used to.
Arrow keys?  Apparently those are for amateurs.
I disabled the arrow keys to force myself to use the hjkl keys for navigation.  It's a work in progress, but after the first hour or so, it's not so bad.

```
" Disable Arrow keys in normal and insert modes
    nnoremap <up>    <nop>
    nnoremap <down>  <nop>
    nnoremap <left>  <nop>
    nnoremap <right> <nop>
    inoremap <up>    <nop>
    inoremap <down>  <nop>
    inoremap <left>  <nop>
    inoremap <right> <nop>
```

## Composability
Vim's commands are composable.

This means you can take commands and use them together. `9<enter>` moves down 9 lines.  `>>` indents.  `9>>` means indent 9 lines.

I know that `dd` means delete a line so `9dd` means delete 9 lines.  `gU` means UPPERCASE.  Guess what `gU3` does?  Correct, it UPPERCASES 3 lines.  If `w` means select token then `gUw` will UPPERCASE the entire word.  `dw` will delete a word.

Each new command greatly increases the amount of work Vim can do for me. __That is what makes Vim exciting to learn for me.__

Also just a neat trick I learned earlier today:

`:r !shellcmd`, where shellcmd is some shell command, will pipe the command's output into your current Vim buffer.
