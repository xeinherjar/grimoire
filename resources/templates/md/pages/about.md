During the day I'm employed by [CodeSmith](http://codesmithdev.com).

By night Iâ€™m into craft beer, cooking, curing and smoking meats and getting my passport stamped.

I'm motivated and I like to be pushed, I am not afraid of new things. I'm into VM's, emulators, self-study, and building things. I need to know how things work. I like things that have a clean design and things that just work.

You can find some of my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/xeinherjar).
